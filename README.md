# **3D Meditation Island** 🏝️
## 🚀 Live Demo
Deployed on Vercel: https://meditation-island.vercel.app/

## 📌 About the Project

3D Meditation Island is an interactive visual environment that I built with Three.js, React Three Fiber, and Drei. It allows you to explore the island, interact with various meditation elements, and enjoy various sounds for relaxation.

I wanted to create a place where anyone can relax and take a break from their busy lives. We use screens all the time for work and entertainment, but not often for peace and mindfulness. 

The ocean, sky, and nature elements in this island are inspired by real places that feel relaxing. I added things like a singing bowl, a sparkling seashell, and a campfire to make it feel soothing.

This project was also a way for me to learn more about 3D web development. I wanted to figure out how to make interactive objects, animations, and a natural-looking world inside a web browser.

## Features
-  🌊 Dynamic 3D Island – Created using Three.js and Sketchfab models.
-  🎵 Sound Effects – Click on objects like the Tibetan singing bowl, fire, or seashells to hear meditation sounds.
-  🐠 Marine Life – Fishes, jellyfish, mermaid and more.
-  🧘‍♀️ Meditation Time – 5 minutes of mindful time.

-  🔥 Campfire Scene – An interactive fire with fire crackling sound effects.
-  🌅 Sky & Sun System – A dynamic sky and sun.
